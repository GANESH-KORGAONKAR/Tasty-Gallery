        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For Gulab Jamun</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>125 grams khoya or mawa (evaporated milk solids) (1 heaped cup, grated)</li>
            <li>2½ tablespoons Maida (all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>2 to 4 tablespoons milk or water (use more if needed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paneer (optional)</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee as needed for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Sugar Syrup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ to 1 ½ cups sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rose water (optional)</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Make Sugar Syrup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To a wide pot, add sugar and water. Heat on a medium flame until the sugar dissolves, then let the syrup boil until it reaches a sticky consistency.</li>
            <li>Take ¼ tsp of it, cool slightly, and check by separating your thumb and forefinger—it should be sticky.</li>
            <li>Add rose water, cardamom powder, and lemon juice. Mix well and set aside to keep the syrup slightly hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Making Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, stir together grated mawa, flour, cardamom powder, and baking powder.</li>
            <li>Pour milk little by little, kneading gently to form a smooth, crack-free dough. Avoid overkneading to maintain the texture.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 14-16 parts.</li>
            <li>Take each ball in your palms, rub it gently a few times until smooth, then roll it into a crack-free ball.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Frying Gulab Jamun</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pot or kadai. Check the oil temperature by gently sliding a small piece of dough—it should rise slowly with bubbles, not brown.</li>
            <li>Regulate the flame to medium. Drop one ball at a time, adding as many as can fit comfortably in the pot.</li>
            <li>Fry the balls, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Adjust the flame to medium-low if needed to fry them uniformly.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried gulab jamuns to a colander, and continue frying the rest.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Soaking the Gulab Jamun</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow the gulab jamuns to cool for 3-5 minutes before adding them to the slightly hot sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>Gently rotate the gulab jamuns in the syrup, ensuring they soak for 45 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve gulab jamun with sugar syrup or vanilla ice cream, garnished with thinly sliced pistachios (optional).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Don’ts for the Sugar Syrup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid using a cast iron pot for the syrup, as it can cause crystallization of the syrup after cooling down.</li>
        </ul>
